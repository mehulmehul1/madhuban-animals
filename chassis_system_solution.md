## 🚗 **Fixed Chassis System - Like Car Wheelbase**

Your analysis is perfect! The current foot placement system is completely wrong. Here's the simple solution:

### **🎯 Problem Analysis:**
- Current system calculates feet based on movement direction and attachment points
- Results in feet bunching up, losing anatomical frame structure
- Front legs can end up behind hind legs during turns

### **🚗 Solution: Fixed Chassis Approach**
Think of creature as having a **fixed rectangular chassis** that rotates as one unit:

```
Fixed Frame (like car wheelbase):
┌─────────────────┐
│  FL         FR  │  ← Front axle (shoulder)
│                 │
│                 │  
│  BL         BR  │  ← Rear axle (hip)
└─────────────────┘
```

### **🔧 Implementation:**

```javascript
// In constructor - define fixed chassis positions
this.chassisPositions = [
    { x: -legSpacing/2, y: shoulderHipDistance/2 },  // front-left
    { x:  legSpacing/2, y: shoulderHipDistance/2 },  // front-right
    { x: -legSpacing/2, y: -shoulderHipDistance/2 }, // back-left  
    { x:  legSpacing/2, y: -shoulderHipDistance/2 }  // back-right
];

// In foot placement - rotate entire chassis as one unit
const cos = Math.cos(creature.bodyHeading);
const sin = Math.sin(creature.bodyHeading);

const rotatedChassisX = chassisPos.x * cos - chassisPos.y * sin;
const rotatedChassisY = chassisPos.x * sin + chassisPos.y * cos;

const targetX = creature.bodyPosition.x + rotatedChassisX;
const targetY = creature.bodyPosition.y + rotatedChassisY;
```

### **✅ This Ensures:**
1. **Fixed spacing**: Front-back and left-right distances never change
2. **Rigid rotation**: Entire frame rotates as one unit with bodyHeading  
3. **No crossing**: Feet can never violate frame boundaries
4. **Scalable**: Works for any creature size/type
5. **Natural movement**: Like real animals and cars

Would you like me to implement this simple chassis system to replace the current complex foot placement?
